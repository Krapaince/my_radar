# My_radar

## Description

2D visualization panel showing a simulation of air traffic.

### Rules
- Aircraft flies from a point A to a point B at a given speed
- If an aircraft collides with another one, the two aircrafts disappear
- Control towers donâ€™t move and have control areas
- Control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed

## Graphical explanation

### Sprite
 - ![Aircraft_sprite](https://github.com/Krapaince/my_radar/blob/master/resources/aircraft.png) Aircraft
 - ![Tower_sprite](https://github.com/Krapaince/my_radar/blob/master/resources/radar.png) Control tower

### Shapes
- The rectangle grid represents a quadtree
- The square represents the aircraft
- The red circle represents control tower area

  The colors of the aircraft and the rectangle grid indicate the depth of the element in the quadtree

| Depth | Color   |
|-------|---------|
| 0     | Green   |
| 1     | Cyan    |
| 2     | Blue    |
| 3     | Magenta |
| 4     | Orange  |
